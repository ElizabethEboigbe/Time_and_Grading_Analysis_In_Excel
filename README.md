## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Excel formulas and functions to perform data analysis and automation tasks.  
It is divided into three main sections:
1. Time functions  
2. Time function student (Student Dataset)  
3. Grading system  

The project highlights how Excel can be used to manipulate dates, extract insights from datasets, and automate grading with formulas.

---

## Project Objectives
This project demonstrates how Excel functions can be applied to automate and simplify complex tasks such as calculating time differences, extracting date components, and building dynamic grading systems. By leveraging formulas instead of manual input, the project highlights how efficiency, accuracy, and consistency can be achieved in handling real-world data challenges.

## 1. Time Functions

### Data Used
[file link for dataset]

### Description
This dataset demonstrates the use of Excel time and date functions to calculate and manipulate values such as differences between dates, extracting parts of dates, and determining weekdays or workdays.

### Key Questions
- How many complete years and months exist between two dates?  
- What is the remaining days difference when years/months are ignored?  
- What weekday does the given date fall on?  
- How can a month number be converted to its name?  
- How is a sheet kept current with todayâ€™s date/time automatically?  
- How many complete years exist between the start date and the end date?  
- What is the total month difference between the start date and end date?  
- Calculate the difference between two dates in years, months, and days.  

### Formulas Used
Reference cells include:  
- `J11 = 01/01/2000 (Start Date)`  
- `M11 = 10/07/2023 (End Date)`  
- `A3 = 2 (month number)`  
- `E2 = Current date (today)`  
- `E3 = Current date and time (now)`  

```excel
=TEXT(A3*29,"MMMM")
=TODAY()
=NOW()
=TIME(10,15,0)
=YEAR(E2)
=MONTH(E2)
=DAY(E2)
=EDATE(E2,-10)
=EDATE(E3,-6)
=EOMONTH(E2,7)
=DATEDIF(J11,M11,"Y")
=DATEDIF(J11,M11,"M")
=DATEDIF(J11,M11,"MD")
=DATEDIF(J11,M11,"YM")
=DATEDIF(J11,M11,"YD")
=DATEDIF(J11,TODAY(),"Y")
=WORKDAY(J11,10)
=WEEKDAY(J11)
